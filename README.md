## 🤔 Why do I need this extension?

NCB prevents the pasting of passwords, and that is a bad practice. It forces users to manually type their password, which can reduce security as users are likely to choose weak passwords that are short enough to remember and type.

By installing this extension you are no longer beholden to NCB's paste
blocking on the login page. You can freely paste your password, and if you have a password manager, easily autofill your credentials 🤯.
